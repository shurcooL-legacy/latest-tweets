_**Note:** This app relies on Twitter API v1, which allows it stay simple and not require authentication. Twitter API v1 is deprecated and will stop functioning on May 7, 2013. As is, this app will stop functioning on that date. I currently have no plans to make it work with authentication and Twitter API v1.1._
